        textBig1: 'When I first got to know IMIGIZE, I thought this is too good to be true. After more than 30 years in the footwear industry, I have come to know many technologies about fitting and measuring. Most of them are way too complicated to be commercialized. Our foot is not as simple as most people think. There are so many bones and joints in our foot and each person walks differently. So, it is almost impossible to get perfect fitting.' +
        '<br><br>' +
        'IMIGIZE has a completely different approach. They use a simple app from mobile phone and scan our feet in a few steps. Then it recommends us for the best possible fit available. This is really a great innovative idea. \n' +
        '<br><br>' +
        'People are buying more and more shoes online nowadays. And the number is increasing drastically. Yet, the return rate is high due to the fitting problem. This is costing the retailers or the brand owners huge amount of money, not simply the courier charge, but also the labour cost at the distribution centers. And this is also a significant impact to our environment as approximate 30% of the shoes sold online were returned.' +
        '<br><br>' +
        'I believe IMIGIZE can reduce the return rate drastically. This is not only making the online retail of shoes more efficient, but also helping us to save our planet as well.' +
